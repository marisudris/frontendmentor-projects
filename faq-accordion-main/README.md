## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What makes an accordion accessible, its semantics + aria attributes necessary. Working without a need for transitions/animations makes it relatively straightforward - basically toggling the `hidden` attribute on the accordion panel elements.
If transitions are necessary (they aren't in this challenge, but I still wanted to add some flair), we can use CSS transitions + JavaScript to animate the height of the panel elements - this, admittedly also breaks the focusability rules (elements in closed panels shouldn't be focusable). Even though there weren't any focusable elements in the panels, I still wanted to adhere to the rules, which meant adding additional logic to the TypeScript/JavaScript code to manage the focusability by toggling the `tabindex` attribute on the focusable elements in the panels.

### Continued development

Learn if there are less JavaScript heavy but accessible solutions for accordion components that have transitions on opening/closing.

### Useful resources
- [**ARIA Accordion Pattern**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/) for accessible accordion markup and rules.

- [**Clamp calculator**](https://www.marcbacon.com/tools/clamp-calculator/)

- **Pixel Perfect Pro** - add-on available for both Chrome and Firefox browsers. This was useful for making quicker comparisons between the design and my solution.
